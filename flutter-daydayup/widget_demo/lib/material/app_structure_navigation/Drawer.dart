/*
A material design panel that slides in horizontally from the edge of a Scaffold to show navigation links in an application.

Drawers are typically used with the Scaffold.drawer property. The child of the drawer is usually a ListView whose first child is a DrawerHeader that displays status information about the current user. The remaining drawer children are often constructed with ListTiles, often concluding with an AboutListTile.

The AppBar automatically displays an appropriate IconButton to show the Drawer when a Drawer is available in the Scaffold. The Scaffold automatically handles the edge-swipe gesture to show the drawer.
