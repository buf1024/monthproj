/*
A material design widget that displays a horizontal row of tabs.

Typically created as the AppBar.bottom part of an AppBar and in conjunction with a TabBarView.

If a TabController is not provided, then a DefaultTabController ancestor must be provided instead. The tab controller's TabController.length must equal the length of the tabs list and the length of the TabBarView.children list.

Requires one of its ancestors to be a Material widget.

Uses values from TabBarTheme if it is set in the current context.

To see a sample implementation, visit the TabController documentation.
