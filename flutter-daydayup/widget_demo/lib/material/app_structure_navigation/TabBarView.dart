/*
A page view that displays the widget which corresponds to the currently selected tab.

This widget is typically used in conjunction with a TabBar.

If a TabController is not provided, then there must be a DefaultTabController ancestor.

The tab controller's TabController.length must equal the length of the children list and the length of the TabBar.tabs list.

To see a sample implementation, visit the TabController documentation.
